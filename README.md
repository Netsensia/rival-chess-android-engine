Rival Chess Java Engine
=======================

The Rival chess Java engine as used in the Rival Chess Android App.

Written in collaboration with Russ Newman (the graphics creator on the DOS and Windows version of Rival).

Russ again developed the graphics and this time also built the Android GUI with the C++ UCI engine being coverted to Java and plugged into Russ's code.

In reality, this was an almost complete rewrite of the C++ engine and plays about 200-300 ECO higher than the old C++ engine when compared on the same hardware.

Some detailed information of the use of magic bitboards in this version of Rival can be found [here](http://www.afewmorelines.com/understanding-magic-bitboards-in-chess-programming/).
